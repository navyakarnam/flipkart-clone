And then it was just like a passing wind that she came and it was just as freezing as it could get.Both my mind and heart all at once.Nobody to talk to and nobody who cared. Was it just an imagination you ask me ahh yes may be because I'm as perplexed as you are. If only silence could be clear than with what words has to offer!It was a dilemma once again!The same feeling with what she was running away all these years and yet landed on the same plane with the same journey that she somehow escaped each time!It is kinda scary to imagine yet feel the warmth helplessly! Well, "going with the flow "is in my genes they say but "they" are dead and I remained.Let's see who can make it go farther!after all it's a new voyage with a known destination but this time the roads taken are new!Unlike the old times which once that helpless kid cried and now it's not the same anymore as the kid is now a King and is now blessed with Royalty!
